# spear-phishing-framework
A framework for sending spoof phishing emails written in PHP and Python.

In order to preserve anonymity, we have had to delete all identifying information including names, email addresses, and student ID numbers. This means that we were unable to include either the .CSV files that contain the data used in this experiment, or the email templates that were sent to the experiement participants.
